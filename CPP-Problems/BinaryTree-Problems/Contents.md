1.cpp => Binary tree structure formation

2.cpp => Preorder,Inorder and Postorder traversal in a Binary Tree

3.cpp => Build Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder sequence

4.cpp => Build Tree from Postorder and Inorder sequence

5.cpp => Level order traversal in Binary Tree(My Code using goto keyword)

6.cpp => Level order traversal in Binary Tree

7.cpp => Sum at kth level of the binary tree

8.cpp => Count nodes in a binary tree

9.cpp => Sum of all nodes in a binary tree

10.cpp => Calculate height of binary tree => O(n) because called for n-nodes and calling each node carries 1 operation

11.cpp => To calculate diameter of binary tree => O(n^2)

12.cpp => Diameter of binary tree (Optimized approach) 

13.cpp => Sum replacement in binary tree

14.cpp => To check complete binary tree or not

15.cpp => Balanced height binary tree -> ie. (leftNodeHeight-rightNodeHeight)<=1

16.cpp => Balanced height binary tree -> ie. (leftNodeHeight-rightNodeHeight)<=1

17.cpp => Balanced height binary tree -> ie. (leftNodeHeight-rightNodeHeight)<=1

18.cpp => Right view of binary tree

19.cpp => Right view of binary tree

20.cpp => Left View of binary tree

21.cpp => Shortest distance between any two nodes of the binary tree

22.cpp => Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

23.cpp => LCA => Optimized approach
